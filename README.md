# Distance

An *experimental* implementation of a rule-based network troubleshooting tool written in C# for .net core target. 
It depends on **tshark** (https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html) for decoding packets and **NRules** (https://github.com/NRules) engine for evaluating rules.

## Set up 
The easiest way of running the tool is to use Vagrant. To do so, just type 
`vagrant up ` in the root folder of the solution. When using Windows and Hyper-V, it is necessary to run this command with elevated privileges. Execute 
`shell.cmd` to open powershell with necessary rights. 



## Usage:

The `DistanceEngine` project is a .NET Core console application that do all the things.  When running in the virtual machine, 
`distance` command is available to run the `DistanceEngine` application. 
The program offers several commands to build and run the diagnostic engine:

```
Usage: distance [options] [command]

Options:
  -?|-help  Show help information
  -debug    Enable debug output.

Commands:
  build  Build a distance ruleset from the source yaml project.
  run    Run a distance ruleset against the specified input file(s).
```

The `build` command is supposed to be used during development, when new rules are added. It compiles new rules to C# source files to be used by the engine.
The `run` command runs the diagnostic engine for provided packet source file. 

### Run Command
The program loads the input pcap, executes `tshark` for decoding packets and applies diagnostic rules. 
The output containing identified issues is written to `.log` file. See bellow for the examples.

```
Usage: distance run [arguments] [options]

Arguments:
  InputPcapFile  An input packet capture file to analyze.

Options:
  -?|-help  Show help information.
  
```

### Build Command
Not implemented yet :(.



## Example
The following is an example of running the tool identifying DNS problems:

```
$ vagrant ssh
[vagrant@localhost]$ mkdir pcap
[vagrant@localhost]$ cd pcap
[vagrant@localhost]$ wget www.fit.vutbr.cz/~rysavy/distance.datasets/testbed-16.pcap
[vagrant@localhost]$ distance run testbed-16.pcap
Loading and decoding packets from '/home/vagrant/pcaps/testbed-16.pcap'...ok [00:00:01.4510746].
Loading rules from assembly 'DistanceRules, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'...ok [00:00:00.0679699].
Compiling rules...ok [00:00:00.0764481].
Creating a session...ok [00:00:00.0151823].
Inserting facts (306) to the session...ok [00:00:00.0392679].
Waiting for completion......done [00:00:00.0707294].
Diagnostic output written to '/home/vagrant/pcaps/testbed-16.log'.
[vagrant@localhost pcaps]$
```

The output is written to `testbed-16.log`. Its content consists of 58 lines each giving information about a single issue found in DNS communication,
for example:

```

While it is still too early to evaluate the performance, the following table contains some preliminary results measured for the DNS diagnostic ruleset (just 4 rules):
